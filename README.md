# TalksBox
An android app which takes a photo of objects in the user's environment and provides translations of the names of those objects to the language of choice for the user.
This app was designed to help with both learning languages by allowing a user to quickly get translations for objects in their environment, as well as assisting users in an environment where they cannot speak their native tongue, but need to quickly identify and communicate the names of objects.

Written in Java in Android studio, this app utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API for image processing and the Google Translate API for providing accurate translations.
2016 HackCMU Hackathon Android app, written by William Paivine, Daniel de Angulo, Jan Orlowski, with assistance from Josh Broitman.
